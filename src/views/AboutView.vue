			We do not collect any personal information about you. No names, email is only used for account recovery - and optional, no phone numbers, nothing. The only data we store is the data you enter into the calculators, and that data is encrypted on your device before it is stored.

			We use industry-standard encryption algorithms to ensure that your data is protected. Your data is encrypted using AES-256 encryption, which is widely regarded as one of the most secure encryption methods available.
